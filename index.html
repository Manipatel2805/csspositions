<h3>1. Essay on the Introduction to Political Parties in Indian Political System:</h3>
<p>All over the world where there is a democratic way of governing the people, political parties play a very big role. These are the heaviest political weight, along with pressure groups and their role, importance and significance can in no way be under-estimated. In a country there can be single as well as multiple political party system.</p>
<p>A single political party being understood to mean a party system in which all members think alike. They follow a leader and have a uniform programme and line of action for achieving that. On the other hand multi-party system is one in which there is more than one political party, each having its programme of action as well as method of achieving the goals which it has set before itself.</p>
<p>For our discussion, a political party means to be a group of persons who have common ideology, follow a common programme and common line of action. In the party there is uniformity of action and approach. It should be well organised and a good political party is supposed to have disciplined membership.

    Every political party obviously tries to capture political power and enlightens the people about failings and falterings of the party in power. A good political party is supposed to have national policies and programmes and tries to meet requirements of all sections of society without any reservations.</p>
<p>It should be organised and its members must be prepared to follow certain well established rules and also believe in peaceful and constitutional methods. Its object should be to capture political power.</p>

    <h3>2. Essay on the Political Parties in India:</h3>
<p>Political party system in India has its own background. The origin of the system can be traced back to 1885 when Indian National Congress was founded. It discussed national political and economic issues though at the initial stages its aim was not to capture political power. Its aim was get certain political reforms from foreign masters.</p>
<p>Political party system in India has its own background. The origin of the system can be traced back to 1885 when Indian National Congress was founded. It discussed national political and economic issues though at the initial stages its aim was not to capture political power. Its aim was get certain political reforms from foreign masters.</p>
<p>The party, however, got divided into two parts namely the Moderates and the Extremists. Almost at all same time, Sir Sayyed Ahmad Khan tried to bring the Muslims together under an umbrella named Muslim League.</p>
<p>The aim of the party was to protect political rights of the Muslims. As a reaction the Hindus formed Hindu Maha Sabha. Subsequently such political parties as the Justice Party,. The Krishak Praja Party, The Scheduled Caste Party, the Unionist Party, etc., were formed. But smelly speaking none of the parties was strictly speaking a political party because none aimed at capturing power but only to have some representation in the Government.

    In India political parties can be placed under various categories. Broadly speaking, these are (a) National, regional, local and adhoc. At the national level some parties are secular and without any ideological commitment e.g., Indian National Congress, including Congress (I), Janata Dal, Janata Party, etc. Then at the national level are ideologically committed rightist and leftist parties.</p>

    <p>In the former category can be placed Bhartiya Janata Party and Bhartiya Lok Dal whereas in the latter category fall both the Communist parties. Then there are regional parties both communal and non-communal. Communal Regional parties include Akali Dal, Indian Union Muslim League, etc.</p>

<p>In India a national party means a political party which has the support of 4% of the electorate in any four states. It has organisational set which spreads in many parts of the country. On the other hand a regional party is ooe which has its hold in a particular region. The activities of a local party are confined to a particular area and does not spread beyond that.

    Indian National Congress (I), Janata Party, Janata Dal, Bhartiya Janata Party and CP I and CPI (M) fall under the category of national parties. These were so recognised by the Election Commission in 1992.</p>

<h3>3. Essay on the Indian National Congress:</h3>
<p>In India since independence Indian National Congress has been a single dominant political party. It continued to dominate Indian political scene to 1967, when its hold somewhat weakened. In 1971, the hold of the party became again strong. But in 1977 the party lost not only at the centre but also in many northern Indian states, where Janata party came to power.

    In 1980 and 1984 elections Congress (I) again got itself saddled in power and authority. In 1989, the party again lost its hold at the Centre, where National Front government came to power. During 1991 the party was returned as the single largest party in the Lok Sabha and formed minority government but in December 1993 when Ajit singh with his followers joined the party, it became a majority government under P.V. Narsimaha Rao.

This single dominant party system has done some good to the country. It was due to this that political stability came in the country, which otherwise the nation would have lost. But at the same time the Congress-men took it for granted that India was for them to be governed and this created many problems as well.

The history of the Congress party is in itself full of many events. There have been splits after splits in the party. Each split of course weakened the party and some of the political parties even find their origin from the main Congress organisation.</p>
<p>History of Congress party can broadly be characterised as that of splits and divisions on the one hand and that of India’s freedom struggle and nation’s progress and advancement on the other. These splits occurred primarily because, though theoretically it was one party, yet practically it was party of parties. In its fold were people of all shades and all sections of Indian society, who had conflicting and contradicting interests and view points.</p>
<p>The party had in its fold both the working classes and employers and the people belonging to all castes and communities. In such an organisation splits were likely to come because there was bound to be struggle for supremacy within the party itself on the one hand and between the party and the government on the other.</p>
<p>Differences so much deepened that in July 1951, both Nehru and Azad resigned from Congress Working Committee as they could not reconcile to the idea of Tandon being the Party President. In October of the same year the latter also resigned from party presidentship.</p>

    <h3>4. Essay on the Party after Nehru:</h3>
<p>In 1964, Jawahar Lal Nehru died and struggle in the party became more tens. It was a time when prices were rising and the people had not forgotten Indiaâ€™s debacle in war against China for which many had held Nehru responsible. But even then Nehru was undisputed leader of India on the one hand and Congress party on the other.</p>
<p>After his death Lal Bahadur Shastri succeeded him, as a Prime Minister, presumably he was considered light political weight. After Shastri’s death on January 11, 1966 struggle for supremacy in the party again started and this time leadership preferred Smt Indira Gandhi, as nation’s Prime Minister over Morarji Desai; again perhaps considering him a light political weight.

    But soon she also proved to be heavy political weight and differences between the Prime Minister and Party President developed. In 1967, fourth general election were to be held in the country. At that tune party was completely disorganised. In every state where were dissidents who had left the party and joined opposition parties, thereby strengthening their hands and position.</p>
<p>Charges of corruption were frequently levied against Ministers and highly placed public servants. The performance of the party was found quite unsatisfactory both on social and economic fronts. There was acute struggle for leadership and for grabbing more and more powers.

    The result of all this was that party received serious setback in 1967 elections. It had much reduced strength in the Lok Sabha and lost majority in seven states, where opposition parties formed government. In the party itself serious rifts came and within the party younger elements formed Congress Socialist Forum and called themselves as ‘Young Turks’.</p>
<p>But even that did not satisfy the party workers, particularly the younger elements who wanted that the task of economic development on the one hand and that of uprooting corruption on the other should be speeded up.

    These elements wanted that maximum responsibility should be thrown on the public sector, whereas in April 1969, party chief at working committee meeting held in that mouth at Faridabad lashed at the inefficiency of that sector and impatience with which some party members wanted to introduce progressive measures.
</p>
<p>They suggested progressive rate of taxation and checks on unproductive expenses. Another suggestion made was that the assistance given to the monopoly houses by the government should be converted into equity holdings and social efforts should be made to finance new entrepreneurs in the less developed regions.</p>

    <h3>5. Essay on the Policies and Programmes of Congress:

    </h3>
